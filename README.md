## JavaScript

**Warning**: I dedicated this repository to my JavaScript study, but if you want to contribute with some content, feel free.

## Why JavaScript?

- JavaScript is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today.
- JavaScript is also a client-side script, speeding up the execution of the program as it saves the time required to connect to the server.
- JavaScript is versatile, you can use JavaScript to do user-side (Front-end) or server-side (Back-End).

## How to use

I'm using node to run JavaScript in the terminal, so to use and see the things that I implemented, it's necessary to run the following command:

```
node ${folder}/index.js
```

Like:

```
node loops/index.js
```
